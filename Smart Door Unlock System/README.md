# Smart Door Unlock System with Raspberry Pi
In this project we are using *facial recognition* technology to identify a person’s face at the door. Eventually, it will be able to differentiate between friends and strangers. If there is some known person, door will open otherwise if there is a stranger, alerts can be sent directly to the owner to let them know someone they don’t know is at the door.
